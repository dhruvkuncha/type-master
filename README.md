# type-master
This project has been developed using Pygame in Python and SQLite.
I always had a liking for the power of a terminal in an operating System and so I designed this program in such a way that it looks and feels simple like a command prompt but is really helpful and resourceful.
This program times your speed in typing and also even checks your accuracy in what you type.
It consists of a main menu where you can start your practice, you can check your previous stats and you can even quit the application.
Type-master starts to time you once you click on the input box and start typing the above mentioned line.
It is so user-friendly that it shows you instantly what and even where you commited mistakes by underlining that particular character so that even if it takes a few extra seconds, your accuracy won't get hit.
After typing the sentence you must press enter button to record that particular attempt. After that you can choose to stop practice or you can give another attempt by clicking on the restart icon.
You can use type master to check your progress and improve your typing speed.
